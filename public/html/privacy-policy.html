                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), please notify us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">litteensocial@gmail.com.</span></p>

                  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, as that term is defined in rules implementing the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act. No part of the Lit Teen Social is directed to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and learn that such child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, then you may alert us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">litteensocial@gmail.com</span>. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such child&rsquo;s Personal Information as well as prohibit the use thereof. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, then we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child&rsquo;s account.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
