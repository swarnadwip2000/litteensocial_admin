App, change eligibility criteria, remove your User Content or deny access, we can do it in our sole and complete discretion and without any liability to you. Usually it will be because something bad has been going on, such as a violation of these Terms, violation of the rights of a third party, or some activity that may cause harm to us, you or other users of the Lit Teen Social &amp; Adventures Ltd. App, and sometimes we might suspend your participation first and then give you a chance to clean up your act. But we don&rsquo;t have to do that; we can just pull the plug or impose other restrictions. Hey, it&rsquo;s our platform, and we need to make sure we can keep it a safe and fun place for everyone.</p>

If you let anyone else log in to the Lit Teen Social &amp; Adventures Ltd. App as you, then as far as we are concerned it is you.

                  <p><u>Screen Names</u></p>
                  <p>When you join, you&rsquo;ll be able to pick a screen name that will identify you on the Lit Teen Social &amp; Adventures Ltd. App. You&rsquo;ll have a fair amount of freedom to pick a screen name you like, but there are some ground rules: Be nice. No obscenities, references to illegal behavior, or terms that others might reasonably find to be threatening or abusive. Don&rsquo;t use anything you don&rsquo;t have the right to, like brands or company names or other proprietary terms or trademarks. Don&rsquo;t use anything that suggests you are someone you are not, like any well-known person. We have the right to review, edit, reject, or delete any screen name, but we don&rsquo;t have to. We can&rsquo;t watch everything, so the fact that a screen name gets displayed on the Lit Teen Social &amp; Adventures Ltd. App doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean we approve of it. You grant us a royalty-free license to use your screen name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content.</p>

You and we agree as follows: (a) neither you nor we will seek to have a dispute between us (&ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;) heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity; (b) no arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding; and (c) if the class action waiver or any part of this Section 19 is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><u>Governing Law</u></p>
                  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the British Columbia, Canada without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the British Columbia, Canada for the purpose of litigating any Dispute.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u></p>
                  <p>You and we agree to arbitrate all Disputes (except those exceptions specifically set out in the next subsection) between you and us or our affiliates, except Disputes related to our intellectual property rights. You and we empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, whether any part of these Terms are void or voidable.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Disputes Excluded from Arbitration: You and we agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit your or our right to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable province or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim or to compel or uphold any arbitration decision hereunder. In such cases, neither you nor we shall need to follow the informal negotiations procedure and timeline set out in the next subsection.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><u>Informal Negotiations</u></p>
                  <p>To help get you and us to a resolution and to control costs for you and us regarding any Dispute, you and we agree to first attempt to informally discuss and try to negotiate a resolution to any Dispute (except the Disputes specifically set out below) for at least 60 days from when notice of the Dispute is sent. Those informal negotiations will commence upon written notice from you to us or us to you. We will send our notice to your registered email address and any billing address that you provided to us. You will send your notice to 2955 138th Street Surrey, BC Canada V4P 1T6, Attn: Lit Teen Social &amp; Adventures Ltd. After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration. If</p>
                  <p>the Dispute cannot be resolved within that time period, and if either you or we desire to continue the Dispute, the party desiring to continue the Dispute shall commence arbitration.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><u>Commencing Arbitration</u></p>
                  <p>If you and we do not resolve a Dispute by informal negotiation, the Dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Canadian Arbitration Act. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY AND GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION. Arbitration will be administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (the &ldquo;ICDR&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;ICDR Rules&rdquo;). You can find more information at www.icdrcanada.org or by calling 1-844-859-0845.</p>
                  <p>Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><u>Fees and Location</u></p>
                  <p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the ICDR Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in British Columbia, Canada, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the ICDR Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the ICDR Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the ICDR Rules.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve Disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><u>Confidentiality of Settlement Offers</u></p>
                  <p>During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award (if any).</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Minimum Award: If you win in the arbitration, and are awarded an amount that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us, we will pay you the highest of the following: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (b) $10,000. Choice of Forum for Disputes That Are Not Subject to Arbitration: You and we agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the provincial courts located in the British Columbia, Canada, and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action.</p>
